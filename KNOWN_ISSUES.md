## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Scanner not working**
- Verify scanner in HID keyboard mode
- Check USB connection
- Test scanner in notepad (should type UPC)
- Adjust timing threshold if needed

**Issue: Items not adding**
- Check transaction state (must be in SHOPPING)
- Verify UPC exists in database
- Check console for error messages

**Issue: Payment disabled**
- Must click "Tender Items" first
- Verify transaction has items
- Check transaction is in TENDERING state

**Issue: Popular items empty**
- No sales data yet - complete transactions first
- Use Tools → Refresh Popular Items
- Check TRANSACTIONS table has data

**Issue: Database connection failed**
- Start H2 server first (automatic on app launch)
- Check port 9092 not in use
- Verify database file permissions

### For Detailed Errors
- Check console output for stack traces
- Review journal logs for transaction flow
- Use IntelliJ Database Tool to inspect data
- Check H2 Web Console (http://localhost:8082)
